    <p>By default, Invoice Falcon generates invoices with 3 addresses in the top section of the invoice.

In this article, we’ll walk you through how you can disable any of these addresses from being shown on the invoice.</p>

<p>Click on <strong>Invoice Design</strong> in the left menu bar of our application &amp; click on <strong>Supplier, Shipping &amp; Billing Addresses</strong> section in this page. You’ll see a few settings that look like this -</p>

To hide your store’s address from the invoice, disable the checkbox labelled ‘Your Address’ in the ‘Addresses in Invoice’ subsection. Re-enable this box if you need to show this address again.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>Show/hide Shipping address</u></strong>
<br />
To hide your customer’s shipping address from the invoice, disable the checkbox labelled ‘Shipping Address’ in the ‘Addresses in Invoice’ subsection. Re-enable this box if you need to show this address again.</p>
